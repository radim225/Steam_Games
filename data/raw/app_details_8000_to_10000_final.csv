It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it's accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new UI, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. Caves of Qud has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations.

As the guardian angel-in-training assigned to watch over Harold as he competes in a series of increasingly complicated and dangerous obstacle courses, you must summon all your otherworldly might to get this hopeless contender across the finish line in first place. Shoot lightning and move heaven and earth to open up new ways forward for Harold while delaying the other racers just long enough for him to win.

He may not be the smartest. He may not be the fastest. He is definitely not the strongest. But you’re in this together. No one said earning your wings would be an easy job.

Key Features

Action-packed racing – Harold will need all the help he can get outrunning the competition while jumping, swinging and sliding across the very many treacherous environmental hazards that litter each course. Use your angelic powers to manipulate objects in the world, send the other racers into traps and light a fire under Harold whenever he starts to fall behind.
Celestial challenges – Harold brings you 12 unique and varied courses across 3 special game modes. Each level offers multiple routes to victory that will require skill and determination to master. While fun and accessible to everyone, only a true guardian will divine the perfect path to first place on each track.
Beautiful hand-drawn animation – Inspired by classic 2D animated films, Harold’s richly drawn characters and vibrant background scenery are a perfect match for its absurd comic premise, creating one of the most visually stunning and stylistic experiences in gaming.","Harold’s going to need a miracle to get through this race in one piece… That’s where you come in!<br />
