With this edition we've re-engineered the game to work on modern PC hardware, upscaled the textures, added widescreen support up to 4K resolution, improved anti-aliasing, HDR, bloom, motion blur, reworked camera, added gamepad support and improved its overall stability. At the same time, the gameplay, content, and the story are untouched — featuring all the game’s quirks and charm.","Action, RPG","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS *:</strong> 64-bit Windows 7, 8.1, 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Dual Core 2Ghz Processor<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> DirectX 11 compatible for 1920x1080<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS:</strong> 64-bit Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 Processor<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 950 / Radeon R7 370 for 4K<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""></ul>","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""></ul>",7-Oct-21,FALSE,"Rebel Act Studios, Fire Falcom, General Arcade",SNEG,USD,1499,599,60,75,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,2203

Animals seek water and shelter, while predators hunt for prey; as day transitions into night, the environment shifts and the creatures who inhabit it change their behaviors. A mystical narrative runs throughout the player’s journey as well, putting the experience into greater, transcendental context.<br><br><i>Song in the Smoke</i> is a beautiful and harrowing survival experience. How long will you last?<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Hunting</strong>: String bows to hunt your own prey, tracking their footprints and scents on the wind. Then hide among the ferns and bushes to line up the perfect shot, aiming naturally with your controllers before letting your handcrafted arrow fly. The player often takes the role of the hunted as well, requiring deft avoidance—or harrowing combat—to stay alive.<br></li><li><strong>Foraging</strong>: Find food, water, and the raw materials needed to build shelter and fire, as well as craft weapons and other items is essential for survival. <br></li><li><strong>Exploring</strong>: The wide open world of Song in the Smoke begs exploration, and moving through it requires curiosity and wit to unravel nature’s many mysteries. The song leads players forward, guiding them through this strange world and revealing a little more about the secret at its heart with each new discovery. <br></li><li><strong>Maximizing Resources</strong>: If you make the kill, make sure nothing is wasted. Stock up on meat, bones, and skins that you can use to keep yourself warm as you move through the world of Song in the Smoke, travelling from lush forests, through ancient valleys, to frozen glaciers. A deep crafting design allows players to build weapons, tools, shelter and fire from the raw materials nature provides.<br></li><li>Total playthrough time: 12-20 hours</li></ul><br><span class=""bb_img_ctn""><video class=""bb_img"" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1787810/extras/277cbed7478440c3fd0c3b71c2dfa818.poster.avif?t=1641521690"" width=360 height=360 ><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1787810/extras/277cbed7478440c3fd0c3b71c2dfa818.webm?t=1641521690"" type=""video/webm; codecs=vp9""><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1787810/extras/277cbed7478440c3fd0c3b71c2dfa818.mp4?t=1641521690"" type=""video/mp4""></video></span><h2 class=""bb_tag"" ><strong>REVIEWS</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Upload VR:</strong> <i>“I am, if you couldn’t tell, quite in love with SitS ...
