In the process you will go to pubs, clubs, vets, tailors, harbors and many other locations as you expand your influence over the city.

Units have a zone of control that makes them tied to the choices you make. Block enemy movements, build superiority in numbers, and gain flanking bonuses by attacking from behind. You can even kick enemies where the sun doesn’t shine to create safe passageways to units that would otherwise get free attacks. If someone grabs a gun, either find cover or go after them to wrestle it away before the bodies start piling up.<br><br><u><strong>Heat mechanics</strong></u><br>When doing your dirty business, you’d be wise to silently extort your way through the underworld. Loud gunfire or shooting enemies will only attract more opposition, and a criminal empire that blows its cover won’t go far.

Progression of the game takes place as you… ahem… “convince” people to sell their businesses and homes to you at a bargain price, or at least turn a blind eye to what you do in their back room. Owning more locations will unlock more items, features, and elements, but will also potentially expose you to a surprise attack from the police or a rival criminal family.<br><br><u><strong>Not just your own story</strong></u><br>While your task is to create an empire of crime or to tear it down, this is not just your story. This is a story of 1960s London with beatniks, mods, lemonheads, rockers and every other cultural identity of the time. It’s also a story of a falling empire. The Cold War UK is shining in the cultural world, but is facing ever-increasing pressure from inside and out. There is a mysterious order trying to tear down the British Empire from the shadows, and who better to fight it than experts of the underworld and the famous Flying Squad.<br><br><u><strong>Reactive Police</strong></u><br>Shady business takes place in obscurity, so police gameplay is more reactive.

With this setting on you are allowed infinite stumbles.

This option disables the mechanic completely.<br></li><li> Easier music rhythms: During the rhythm run mechanic, use less complicated rhythms to make the game easier.<br></li><li> Single jump button only: After the first few rhythm runs the game will introduce a second jump button to introduce difficulty and complexity. This option will mean you only ever require a single jump button during the rhythm mechanic.<br></li><li> Weather and Environment: How strongly poor weather will affect your health and recovery.<br></li><li> Lightning: By default switched on, this is a strobe effect during thunderstorms that can be disabled.<br></li><li> Highlight routes when looking further: By default switched on, when using the &quot;Look Further&quot; mechanic (zooming out), this will highlight the available surface that can be walked and climbed on for easier navigation.

This option disables the mechanic completely.<br></li><li> Easier music rhythms: During the rhythm run mechanic, use less complicated rhythms to make the game easier.<br></li><li> Single jump button only: After the first few rhythm runs the game will introduce a second jump button to introduce difficulty and complexity. This option will mean you only ever require a single jump button during the rhythm mechanic.<br></li><li> Weather and Environment: How strongly poor weather will affect your health and recovery.<br></li><li> Lightning: By default switched on, this is a strobe effect during thunderstorms that can be disabled.<br></li><li> Highlight routes when looking further: By default switched on, when using the &quot;Look Further&quot; mechanic (zooming out), this will highlight the available surface that can be walked and climbed on for easier navigation.

And to the days where Jack O’Hara, the Green Beret, and his five companions met to form the infamous unit sent to complete missions which no others would dare to accept.<br><br>In the hushed shadows of history’s most pivotal moments, where heroes are born and legends are forged, a new chapter awaits.
