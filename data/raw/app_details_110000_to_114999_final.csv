<br />
Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heores is the world's first Online multiplayer game to utilize Locus Chain Blockchain technology to achieve serverless online gaming experience.  We're thrilled to announce a brand-new player dashboard feature (User Game Record System) that's now available for all players of Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes, a serverless online multiplayer game. We're about to dive into the world of detailed match data, and it's all thanks to the groundbreaking technology of the Locus Chain blockchain, the rock-solid foundation of KUF: A War of Heroes.<br />
With this innovative feature, you're not just playing; you're witnessing the evolution of your gaming prowess. Dive into the numbers, and you'll find everything from your win rate and unit score to your building score and total playtime. Each match's distinctive characteristics are securely recorded on the Locus Chain blockchain. It's like having a treasure trove of your past battles right at your fingertips!<br />
What sets this apart is the way we're presenting your achievements. Every game result now leaves a footprint on the blockchain, carrying all the crucial metadata you could ever desire. Our blockchain-based leaderboard offers a tamper-proof view of your journey up the gaming ranks. It's the ultimate proof of your progression along the steep learning curve of Kingdom Under Fire: A War of Heroes. We firmly believe that introducing this blockchain-powered leaderboard is a crucial leap forward for esports, where individual player stats are the key to entering the realm of high-stakes battles.<br />
<br />
The application of blockchain to KUF involves implementing the blockchain as a distributed database, with no manipulation of NFTs or digital assets, including cryptocurrency.<br />
<br />
Kingdom Under Fire is a real-time strategy game created for the loyal fans of the original Diablo and Starcraft games. The current version is in Early Access with solid plans to release the full game with enhanced graphics preserving the spirit of the original KUF!<br />

In Bersia, the land of Helimo’s blessing, the god of light, there were many species living together, including a large number of humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and ogre monsters, vampires, and lycanthropes. The humans of Bersia flourished, forming a state, serving the gods, and fighting monsters.<br />
The harmony of Bersia, which had been maintained according to its own laws throughout its long history, was broken by the war waged by Khilliani, a black wizard who learned to command monsters and dark forces with powerful magic. The dark forces systematically and meticulously invaded human territory, turning even the largest and most powerful of the countries that humans founded into ruins…Now it’s your turn to fight evil!<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
–Intense RTS action: build structures, manage resources, conquer your enemies!<br />
–Two factions to choose from: orcs and humans.<br />
–The game blends RPG and RTS elements.<br />
–Isometric perspective, high fantasy setting.<br />
–Looks and feels like Starcraft (the graphics will be overhauled in the full version)<br />
–Two modes: single player and multiplayer.<br />
–Play and explore 13 missions in single player mode, following along the story and fighting the AI.<br />
–Up to 8 players can play the game in multiplayer mode<br />
–Upgrade buildings, weapons, and armors to defeat the monsters. Alone or with friends!","Kingdom Under Fire : War of Heros Gold Edition<br />
