Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberl’s future will be laid bare…and some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.<br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><h2 class=""bb_tag"" >A More Personal Adventure</h2><i>Trails in the Sky</i> has become a fan favorite for thoughtfully written characters down to its NPCs, and for its final installment further focuses on fleshing out its playable cast via Moon and Star doors found as the story progresses.<br><br></li><li><h2 class=""bb_tag"" >Familiar Tactics, Brutal Combat</h2>Widely considered the most challenging title in the series, players are encouraged to iterate upon the combat style they’ve come to know in<i> the 3rd</i>’s predecessors by either enjoying its in-depth story on Easy or crying with frustration on its unforgiving Nightmare difficulty. <br><br></li><li><h2 class=""bb_tag"" >One More from Falcom Sound Team jdk</h2>Nihon Falcom is known for its brilliant music, and the <i>Trails</i> series has never been an exception, with <i>the 3rd</i> adding dozens of new tracks to keep players engaged as they journey through Phantasma.<br><br></li><li><h2 class=""bb_tag"" >Even More Olivier</h2>As if two Sky games was enough Olivier.</li></ul>",RPG,"Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Trading Cards, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows XP<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Pentium III 550 MHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 512 MB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 32 MB VRAM, 3D accelerator compatible w/ DirectX 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 5 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Compatible with DirectX 9.0c</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows Vista or later (64-bit supported)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core 2 Duo 2GHz or higher<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 1 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> 64 MB VRAM, 3D accelerator compatible w/ DirectX 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0c<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 6 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Sound Card:</strong> Compatible with DirectX 9.0c</li></ul>",,,,,"May 3, 2017",False,Nihon Falcom,"XSEED Games, Marvelous USA, Inc.",USD,2999,2999,0,83,True,False,False,1898

Creepy Castle is an exploratory, sidescrolling RPG about an awesome moth, conveniently named Moth, who aims to uncover the vast secrets of a creepy castle. It’s a fresh and charming adventure with the looks of a classic, but don’t be fooled by its retro appearance—it’ll kill you with modern gameplay mechanics. A twist on traditional turn-­based combat, Duels offer players a chance to score free hits on their opponent by performing well. Players shouldn’t let their guard down outside of Duels, however, or they might allow Moth to be squished by one of the castle’s many real-­time dangers, like traditional run-­and-­jump platformers.

Features:
● Creepy Castle follows not just one, but many stories, with each scenario taking players on a multiple ­hour adventure! ​Each story has its own characters, plot and different gameplay.
● Duel it out with a multitude of denizens and bosses in the game’s​ unique turn-based combat​ system and utilize the element of skill to overcome each foe! Each enemy has their own type of Duel​ and also their own special twist that they bring to battle.
● Collect various dusty tomes that contain wisdom, scribbled musings of madmen and dog­eared correspondence which help form a​ comprehensive collection of lore​ that gives insight into the ​ Dopterra universe​!
● Players can customize their interface to their liking! Choose from various window skins​,​ character glow filters and even​ health bars and hearts​ for both the player and enemies!

You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself.<br><br>Portals riddle the planar metropolis of Sigil, providing access to anywhere in existence, but only if you have the proper key. Known as the &quot;City of Doors,&quot; Sigil is a neutral ground where demons, devas, and races from across the multiverse gather under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the city's enigmatic ruler. This is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines reality, and belief has the power to reshape worlds.<br><br>In your search for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes: a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube, a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these companions and others at The Nameless One’s side, you will explore worlds in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped and some memories cost more than an even an immortal can bear.<h2 class=""bb_tag"" >Features</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Enhanced Planescape</strong>: Gameplay updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to best capture the original vision for the game.<br></li><li><strong>The Planes Await</strong>: Planescape is a setting you've never experienced before, filled with strange magics, strange adversaries, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons locations from across the multiverse.<br></li><li><strong>Conversations to Remember</strong>: Encounter personable items, philosophic undead, and rat hiveminds while walking the planes with the strangest collection of allies ever seen in an RPG.<br></li><li><strong>Pick Your Path</strong>: Character creation is just the beginning.

But how does that look in practice?<h2 class=""bb_tag"" >GAMEPLAY</h2><strong>Gameplay in Bohemian Killing is a combination of a courtroom drama, and a walking simulator. It can be classified as a first person experience, or a first person interactive story adventure game.</strong><br><br>The story is set within two time frames. In the present, you find yourself locked up in the courtroom. You're getting acquainted with the evidence, witness testimony and questions posed by the Judge. Each question triggers a flashback - and begins your testimony. During the flashback you find yourself in a Parisian district, with each of your decisions, interactions and action affecting Alfred Ethons' testimony and the final verdict.<br><br>To help you in your testimony, you'll have access to all the evidence gathered on the case - expert opinions, reports and witness testimonies. Each of them can be (but doesn't have to be!) refuted in a number of different ways.<br><br>In the <i>Evidence</i> menu you can familiarize yourself with testimonies of witnesses, forensic expertises, physical evidences, etc. They are grouped into appropriate categories, making them easy to find.<br><br><i>Sample:</i><br>A neighbor testified that at approximately 10 p.m. he passed you in the entrance of the tenement house, noticing that your clothes were covered in blood? Try testifying that your neighbor lies and prove that he has a reason to do so. Or maybe you'll get into a bar fight just a few minutes before, so that you can testify that the blood the neighbor saw was yours, and not the victim's? Or maybe you will cut yourself while shaving, covering your clothes with blood that the neighbor sees later? But what if the court finds your time of shaving conspicuous and torments you with even more questions? How will you get out of this?<br><br>With a wide range of possibilities that can lead to several standard endings and one additional hidden one, the game doesn't consider any path &quot;a bad one&quot;, ensuring that each playthrough will be different.<br><br><strong>To adjust the game to the preferences of each player, two modes are available:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>In the <i>Standard</i> mode, the outcome depends entirely on your creativity and ability to solve logical problems. You will suffer the consequences of your own actions.<br></li><li>In the <i>Story</i> mode, your attorney will advise you as you progress along, commenting on your decisions and choices, preventing you from acting in a way that might prove to be harmful in the eyes of the court. </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"" >VOICE ACTING</h2>The main character of the game is played and dubbed by a world-class film and voice actor, <strong>Stephane Cornicard!</strong><br><br>Stephane Cornicard studied in France, at the prestigious Colby College in the US, and at Goldsmith College in the UK. He played in numerous blockbusters such as “Spectre,” the most recent Bond film, or Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan”.<br>His career as a voice actor is no less impressive and includes Syphon Filter, Primal, Metal Gear Solid, and the Dragon Age and Total War series. He currently teaches drama at the Actor’s Centre in London.","<strong>Steampunk Paris, set against the background of the late 19th century, torn between tradition and modernity.

Alfred Ethon, a young inventor of Gypsy origin, benefits from the change, becoming a symbol of success thanks to his hard work and innovative projects, well ahead of their time.<br><br>Soon, a young woman is brutally murdered - a maid working for an impoverished Lord, a relic of the old French regime.

But how does that look in practice?<h2 class=""bb_tag"" >GAMEPLAY</h2><strong>Gameplay in Bohemian Killing is a combination of a courtroom drama, and a walking simulator. It can be classified as a first person experience, or a first person interactive story adventure game.</strong><br><br>The story is set within two time frames. In the present, you find yourself locked up in the courtroom. You're getting acquainted with the evidence, witness testimony and questions posed by the Judge. Each question triggers a flashback - and begins your testimony. During the flashback you find yourself in a Parisian district, with each of your decisions, interactions and action affecting Alfred Ethons' testimony and the final verdict.<br><br>To help you in your testimony, you'll have access to all the evidence gathered on the case - expert opinions, reports and witness testimonies. Each of them can be (but doesn't have to be!) refuted in a number of different ways.<br><br>In the <i>Evidence</i> menu you can familiarize yourself with testimonies of witnesses, forensic expertises, physical evidences, etc. They are grouped into appropriate categories, making them easy to find.<br><br><i>Sample:</i><br>A neighbor testified that at approximately 10 p.m. he passed you in the entrance of the tenement house, noticing that your clothes were covered in blood? Try testifying that your neighbor lies and prove that he has a reason to do so. Or maybe you'll get into a bar fight just a few minutes before, so that you can testify that the blood the neighbor saw was yours, and not the victim's? Or maybe you will cut yourself while shaving, covering your clothes with blood that the neighbor sees later? But what if the court finds your time of shaving conspicuous and torments you with even more questions? How will you get out of this?<br><br>With a wide range of possibilities that can lead to several standard endings and one additional hidden one, the game doesn't consider any path &quot;a bad one&quot;, ensuring that each playthrough will be different.<br><br><strong>To adjust the game to the preferences of each player, two modes are available:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>In the <i>Standard</i> mode, the outcome depends entirely on your creativity and ability to solve logical problems. You will suffer the consequences of your own actions.<br></li><li>In the <i>Story</i> mode, your attorney will advise you as you progress along, commenting on your decisions and choices, preventing you from acting in a way that might prove to be harmful in the eyes of the court. </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"" >VOICE ACTING</h2>The main character of the game is played and dubbed by a world-class film and voice actor, <strong>Stephane Cornicard!</strong><br><br>Stephane Cornicard studied in France, at the prestigious Colby College in the US, and at Goldsmith College in the UK. He played in numerous blockbusters such as “Spectre,” the most recent Bond film, or Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan”.<br>His career as a voice actor is no less impressive and includes Syphon Filter, Primal, Metal Gear Solid, and the Dragon Age and Total War series. He currently teaches drama at the Actor’s Centre in London.","Adventure, Indie","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Full controller support, Steam Trading Cards, Captions available, Family Sharing","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Microsoft Windows 7 32bit<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 1,66 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Radeon HD 7500G/Intel HD Graphics 3000<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 8 GB available space</li></ul>",,"<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Mac OS X 10.8.5<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 1.7<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Radeon HD 7500G/Intel HD Graphics 3000<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 8 GB available space</li></ul>",,,,"Jul 21, 2016",False,The Moonwalls,Libredia Entertainment,USD,1299,1299,0,55,True,True,False,110
