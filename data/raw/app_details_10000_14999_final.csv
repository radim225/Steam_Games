We have got some reports about the title above.

We investigated about it and verified the same phenomenon.
When we played online multi play with specific players who are called cheaters and tamper their game data, our save data became aberrant by obtaining tampered items after the mission.

We will keep investigating about malicious data tampering, but for now, once your save data is tampered, it is impossible to get your data back again.
We would appreciate for your understanding.

As a workaround for customers, since this phenomenon is caused by playing online play with cheaters and completing missions, if you find any cheaters or players who are suspected as cheaters in the online room, we deeply recommend you to leave the room as soon as possible without launching the mission.

In addition, if you find any cheaters or players who are suspected as cheaters during the mission, we also recommend you to leave the mission before you complete it.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>It's a fight for the future of the planet between the Ravagers, a merciless swarm of alien invaders, and the Earth Defense Force (EDF) in this third-person shooter.

Blurring the lines between the RPG and strategy genres, Megamagic recaptures the unmistakable flavour of the 80s in a game filled with pop culture references and magnified by the incredible music by Mitch Murder, composer of<i> Kung Fury</i> and <i>Hotline Miami 2</i> soundtracks. <br><br>Megamagic features a deep combat system that put five different schools of magic at your command, challenging you to unveil the secrets hidden in monster-infested wastelands, neon-bathed cities and shady dungeons alike. Learn new spells and summon the creatures you have beaten, leading a powerful army of grims on your own style. You will need to rely on your ever-growing grimoire, developing your own playstyle as you become the greatest wizard in the world... and the last hope to discover what the sacred institution of the Order is hiding behind their unsullied facade.<h2 class=""bb_tag"" ><strong>Features</strong></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Action RPG meets Real Time Strategy in a totally new way. <br></li><li>Explore an open world and venture into the depths of perilous dungeons. <br></li><li>Master 5 different magical alignments: Neonmancy, Vegemancy, Sanctumancy, Fulgomancy and Necromancy.   <br></li><li>Research and craft 20 spells + 16 grims, each with their own passive and active unique skills. <br></li><li>Beat 9 hair-raising bosses.<br></li><li>Local multiplayer co-op mode: have up to 4 player companions controlling your grims in battle!<br></li><li>Original soundtrack by 80's synth-surfer Mitch Murder.</li></ul>","Action, Adventure, Indie, RPG, Strategy","Single-player, Multi-player, Co-op, Steam Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Partial Controller Support, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 4400<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 9.0<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 7/8/10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Inte Core i3 (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 650 (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Snow Leopard or later<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 4400<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Snow Leopard or later<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Inte Core i3 (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 650 (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Latest Ubuntu / SteamOS<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Intel HD Graphics 4400<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Latest Ubuntu / SteamOS<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Inte Core i3 (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GTX 650 (or similar)<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>","Apr 20, 2016",False,BeautiFun Games,BeautiFun Games,USD,999,999,0,67,True,True,True,
