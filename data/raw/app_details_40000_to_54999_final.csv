With that said, Minoria does contain some similarities with my previous projects (especially Momodora’s latest installment, Reverie Under the Moonlight).<br><br>I am proud of what we’ve been making for Minoria, and I hope you will enjoy the story and characters I’ve prepared this time around!<br><br><span class=""bb_img_ctn""><video class=""bb_img"" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/940910/extras/45f39f43a474ef57d9aa7a7e891b6f3c.poster.avif?t=1751610521"" width=480 height=270 ><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/940910/extras/45f39f43a474ef57d9aa7a7e891b6f3c.webm?t=1751610521"" type=""video/webm; codecs=vp9""><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/940910/extras/45f39f43a474ef57d9aa7a7e891b6f3c.mp4?t=1751610521"" type=""video/mp4""></video></span><br><br><span class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/940910/extras/b111340302db5498b88eb806b090ab20.avif?t=1751610521"" width=594 height=118 /></span><br>Howdy folks, Dan here from Dangen Entertainment. It’s been hard patiently waiting for the announcement of Minoria, knowing what an amazing game it’s going to be. It combines everything I love about the Momodora games with stronger emphasis on a solemn story. I love how Bombservice is approaching the visuals this time around too--it’s a unique take that looks beautiful and shows another evolutionary step in the team’s development experience, just as previous titles have. <br><br>This game is extraordinary.

But if anyone can destroy them, it’s you: you’ve already killed a powerful undead lich, and your sovereign was so impressed that he gave you a town in return. As the ruler of this new settlement, you’ll fend off invading goblin armies, flesh-eating bats, and feuding warriors in your quest to build a thriving community.<br><br>Now that you have your own stronghold, will you raise an army to repel the monsters once and for all? Or will you hold power for a lifetime without ever attacking another soul? Harness your strength, cunning, and even magic to defend your citadel and help your people prosper.<br><br>Invest in trade, mining, or farming—but choose your favorites wisely. Show mercy and forgiveness to your enemies, or be bold and aggressive as you expand your realm. Will the burden of governance make you serious and solemn, or will you retain your sense of humor and win fans near and far? Which groups will you please, when you can’t ever please everyone? And when the end draws near, will you be respected, forgotten, or reviled?<br><br>Will you triumph as a great leader, or see your stronghold fall?<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Play as male, female, or non-binary, gay or straight.<br></li><li> Enjoy an epic fantasy of adventure, friendship, and city-building.    <br></li><li> Lead your people as a bold warrior, clever diplomat, or fledgling sorcerer.    <br></li><li> Defeat a goblin army or make peace with your people's oldest enemies.<br></li><li> Rule on blood feuds between your townspeople, or just judge the best pickles at the harvest fair.    <br></li><li> Court a spouse (or two), or found a new family with a sworn sibling.<br></li><li> Select an heir to continue your legacy.</li></ul>","Adventure, Indie, RPG","Single-player, Steam Achievements, Captions available, Steam Cloud, Family Sharing","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br></li><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 7</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li></ul>","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> 10.13</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""></ul>","<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 20.04</li></ul>","<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""></ul>","Nov 16, 2018",False,Choice of Games,Choice of Games,USD,699,699,0,81,True,True,True,

Watch your step or be swallowed by the darkness.,"<h1>A Letter from Virgil, CEO, Lightmatter Technologies</h1><p>Dear Visitor,<br><br>If you are reading this, you are quite fortunate.<br><br>You have been personally invited to the world debut of Lightmatter—the greatest breakthrough in renewable energy since the sun was born. I know. You must barely be able to contain your excitement.<br><br>This invitation includes a one hour tour through my facility, a ten second glance at the launch of Lightmatter, as well as five seconds of eye contact—with me. If that is not enough, bring your wallet. An investment will give you the full tour and prolong our time together. If you behave, I will even let you shake my hand.<br><br>During the tour, you will witness mind bending technological wonders. They might force you to think in ways that are difficult for you. But don’t worry, you will come out a smarter human being. The only thing I ask of you before you enter my facility, is to embrace the future, open your mind, and your backpack. Yes, cameras, journals, and other useless items will be confiscated by James, my head of security. Don’t try to shake his hand, he might break yours.<br><br>- Virgil<br>CEO, Lightmatter Technologies<br><br>PS: During your visit, you might stumble into our cat, Lux. So if you experience skin rashes, headaches, or hair-loss keep in mind that you might be allergic to cats.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><span class=""bb_img_ctn""><video class=""bb_img"" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/994140/extras/e32ed33cd05150e2bb505628e132c645.poster.avif?t=1701902954"" width=616 height=346 ><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/994140/extras/e32ed33cd05150e2bb505628e132c645.webm?t=1701902954"" type=""video/webm; codecs=vp9""><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/994140/extras/e32ed33cd05150e2bb505628e132c645.mp4?t=1701902954"" type=""video/mp4""></video></span><br><strong>An Homage to First Person Puzzlers</strong><br>Play Tunnel Vision Games’ love-letter to the genre.

Develop your peasants into a highly trained and deadly efficient clan of warriors who are ready to die with your name on their lips.","<h1>Packed with details &amp; innovation</h1><p><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Strategy Over Production</strong> - With a limited number of units at the player's disposal, victory is in the hands of the player who outthinks rather than outnumbers his opponent. <br></li><li><strong>Living Resource System</strong> - Peasants face a multitude of choices. Should they gather resources, construct buildings or perhaps train to become soldiers?<br></li><li><strong>Unit Alchemy</strong> - Peasants may become soldiers. Soldiers may then become specialists in various disciplines or study and acquire new combat abilities.<br></li><li><strong>Immersive Combat</strong> - All units have unique animations for all occasions, the fights are fluid and enjoyable to observe.<br></li><li><strong>Retreat</strong> - Attempting to save as many of your units as possible is an important strategy. After a minute of rest, your units will be almost as good as new, ready to attack again. <br></li><li><strong>Running and Walking</strong> - Running offers players a number of choices: should they slowly sneak through the forest and save their stamina for special attacks, or should they run in and try to catch enemies off guard?<br></li><li><strong>Strategic Surroundings</strong> - Fire consumes buildings if not extinguished, birds will give away enemy positions if startled, wild animals attack lone wanderers and boulders can be pushed to deal devastating damage.<br></li><li><strong>Battle Gears</strong> - Unit abilities that were designed to give units versatility they wouldn't otherwise have. Each clan acquires its Battle Gears by different means.<br></li><li><strong>Yin and Yang</strong> - By awarding Yin and Yang points based on performance in battle, the game incentivizes players to actually get out there and fight.<br></li><li><strong>Zen Masters</strong> - Each clan has its share of heroic figures known as Zen Masters, their powers vary as widely as the heroes they stem from. Strongly connected to their particular alignment, Zen Masters benefit from the presence of Yin or Yang.<br></li><li><strong>Forest</strong> - Forests are not obstacles, but rather terrain to be used. Troops can enter the forest and will be largely invisible to their opponents. Care must be taken when moving through the woods - move too quickly, and birds scatter from the trees, alerting enemy players to movement. <br></li><li><strong>Line of Sight</strong> - Gaining control of the high ground and forests is an important strategy, as shroud wouldn't allow players to effectively strategize. <br></li><li><strong>Weather</strong> - Rain slows the advance of all units, extinguishes building fires and helps rice regrow faster. Snow slows the rice growth and unit movement down.</li></ul></p><br><h1>Steam Greenlight</h1><p>This game has been Greenlit by the Community back in 2014.

Instead they're just added to the normal outfits menu, and unlocked the same way the rest of them are: by spending Confidence points. <br><br>And just like all the other outfits, they're purely cosmetic.<h2 class=""bb_tag"" >The full soundtrack</h2>2 hours and 10 minutes of original music over 47 tracks by composer Robert Arzola, in high quality mp3 format. This is integrated into Steam soundtrack system, as well as just being in a folder on disk.<h2 class=""bb_tag"" >The Lost Demo</h2>Before we settled on the demo we eventually released, we tried an overly ambitious concept: after defeating the Traffic Warlock in the campaign, Jen and Zan would start glitching forwards in time, glimpsing future content. It culminates in a level where they get to decide both how much of their future they want to see, and also the difficulty of the encounter, by choosing when to seal doors that are spawning enemies and allies from deeper into the game. All while those characters announce their arrival by making meta commentaries on their role in the story or game design.<br><br>Shockingly, this proved too complicated and weird for new players to grasp in the space of two levels, so we ended up building something much simpler. But we think the bespoke levels for the complex version might be fun to play once you do know the game, so we're including them here.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Tactical Breach Wizards is a turn-based tactics game in which you lead a team of renegade wizards in kevlar, as they unravel a modern conspiracy plot and/or find the most stylish way to punch a Traffic Warlock through a 4th story window.<br><br>It's a story-driven campaign of about 14 hours, in which you...<h2 class=""bb_tag"" >Combo spells for satisfying results</h2>Each of your wizards has a unique set of abilities, from a straightforward lightning bolt to transforming into a rabid dog. <br><br><span class=""bb_img_ctn""><video class=""bb_img"" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1043810/extras/66e5f9826352aea17e828fc8a7d6439d.poster.avif?t=1743032524"" width=614 height=200 ><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1043810/extras/66e5f9826352aea17e828fc8a7d6439d.webm?t=1743032524"" type=""video/webm; codecs=vp9""><source src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1043810/extras/66e5f9826352aea17e828fc8a7d6439d.mp4?t=1743032524"" type=""video/mp4""></video></span><h2 class=""bb_tag"" >Experiment freely, rewind your mistakes</h2>When you hit a tricky situation, try every wild idea you have - you can always rewind if it didn't pan out.

Characters loyal to your cause have a set of unique cards and abilities that may augment your deck in powerful, exciting ways. Defeat each of the elite opponents in your path to the city's Guard Captain and cripple the Enders at their core. You and your brethren may fall at this attempt, but there will always be others to carry the torch. House Blackfoot will remember, and they will never relent.

The quality, depth, and acceptance of indie metroidvanias like Axiom Verge &amp; Hollow Knight proved what can be achieved by small teams or even single persons. Those developers inspired me to allocate even more personal resources and dedication to the project so it could eventually evolve into something really special.<br><br>As a father, daytime employee, and gamer myself I loved how progression and iteration were tackled in outstanding indie platformer Celeste, so <strong>OUTBUDDIES</strong> was designed to provide challenging and encouraging gameplay while skipping punishing throwbacks and grinding mechanics in total.

It really immerses you in the interesting world they've created.<br><br><strong>Expert Sim Sorcerer</strong>: My opinion is there is nothing quite like the My Time games on the market. I like them even better than SDV (and that's supposed to be the cozy gaming gold standard) but I wasn't really invested in the story or cared about the characters that much.</p><br><h1>EXTENSIVE STORIES FOR NPCs</h1><p><span class=""bb_img_ctn""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1084600/extras/ceba322fdfa031664d1818cb239a2da8.avif?t=1758092038"" width=600 height=909 /></span></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><p class=""bb_paragraph"" >Want a bigger discount?

I mean, did you hear that song in the trailer? That's original music, baby! I'm a sucker for games with quirky themes and original music, so of course, I took notice to this one straight away.

I mean, did you hear that song in the trailer? That's original music, baby! I'm a sucker for games with quirky themes and original music, so of course, I took notice to this one straight away. Mix that with the animals-as-people motif and spot-on detective visuals, and yeah I didn't really stand a chance.&quot;</i><br><br><strong>ROCK PAPER SHOTGUN:</strong> <i>&quot;Fortunately I’m batting my jet-lagged eyes at Chicken Police, an upcoming noir detective adventure with grizzled chickens and a very good raccoon.

It’s a cinematographic masterpiece.&quot;</i><br><br><strong>ALPHA BETA GAMER:</strong> <i>&quot;It really nails the film noir vibe it’s going for.
